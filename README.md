## Overview

The See-Saw project investigates the spread and impact of the term "equalism" within South Korean online communities. Despite being exposed as a fictitious concept lacking factual basis, "equalism" has gained a surprising foothold as an anti-feminist ideology. This project utilizes online text data to explore how "equalism" masks severe misogyny and how its proponents increasingly align with far-right, anti-intellectual ideologies.

## Project Structure

1. **Introduction**: Context and motivations for exploring "equalism" in online discourse.
2. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Gathering and preparing text data from sources like Namuwiki and online forums, tracking historical edits and debates.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analytical techniques used to decode the usage patterns and implications of "equalism."
4. **Suggestions**: Recommendations for media literacy and online discourse regulation.
5. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and the social impact of digital misinformation.

## Technologies

- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Analysis**: Python, NLP Techniques
